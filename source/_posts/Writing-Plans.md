These are some articles that we are interested in writing:

+ Eulerian Path and its applications like passcode (e.g. crack the safe)
+ Binary Search
+ Prefix Sums and probably Binary Indexed Trees
+ Dynamic Programming
+ Onepass Algorithms (one pass after preprocessing: lc316)
+ Padding?
+ Balanced Trees
+ Recursion vs Stack
+ Greedy Algorithms like Dijkstra etc.
+ ...
